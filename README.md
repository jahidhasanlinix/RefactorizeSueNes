# Refactorize SueNes Using HuggingFace Transformer Library​

[SueNes paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.175/)

- Jobayer Ahmmed

## Run The Experiment Automatically
- Open a Linux Terminal
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/SigmaWe/SueNes_RE.git`
- Go to SueNes_RE directory: `cd SueNes_RE`
- Give execution permission to run.sh file: `chmod +x run.sh`
- Finally, run the script: `source run.sh`

We trained two different models from the same checkpoint. One is using Tensorflow
and other one is using PyTorch. The run.sh scipt runs all the python files for training the two models and testing them with sample data. For testing, we call our trained model with 
three pairs of document and summary. The original scores and the predicted scores are shown 
in the terminal.

The rest of the part is step-by-step instructions.

## Repeat Transformer-based Experiments
<!-- Please read [README.md](transformer/README.md) -->
The `transformer` directory contains code for training transformer-based models with different datasets.
The datasets were generated using `sentence delete` or `word delete` techniques
mentioned in the SueNes [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.175/).

### Environmet Setup
You can create virtual environment using Python or Conda.

#### Python venv (CPU Only)

- `python3 -m venv .venv`
- `source .venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
- `pip install transformers datasets scikit-learn evaluate pyyaml h5py`
- Issue: replace `from keras.saving.hdf5_format` by `from tensorflow.python.keras.saving.hdf5_format` 
    at line 39 of `.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/modeling_tf_utils.py`

#### Conda venv (GPU)
- Create venv following [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux) documentation
- `pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets tensorflow_hub`
- Install PyTorch following [this](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) documentation
- `pip install joblib numpy nltk matplotlib bs4 spacy stanza`
- `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
- `pip install transformers datasets scikit-learn evaluate pyyaml h5py`

### Generate Datasets
- `mkdir exp exp/data exp/result`
- `cd pre`
- `python3 sentence_scramble.py`
- `python3 sample_generation.py`

### Bert Tiny CNN Daily Mail TensorFlow
Code for the model is in `bert_tiny_cnndm_tf.py` file.
This model is trained from checkpoint found in 
[prajjwal1/bert-tiny](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny). 
Data is generated from CNN Daily Mail dataset using 
[SueNes](https://github.com/forrestbao/SueNes).
Only `sentence delete` technique, defined in 
SueNes [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.175/),
is used for data generation.
Only 10% data is considered from CNN Daily Mail dataset's train split
for generating train split for our experiment.

#### Train Model
- `cd transformer`
- `python3 bert_tiny_cnndm_tf.py`

#### Test Model
- `python3 bert_tiny_cnndm_tf_wrap.py`

### Bert Tiny CNN Daily Mail PyTorch
Code for the model is in `bert_tiny_cnndm_pt.py` file.
This model is trained from checkpoint found in 
[prajjwal1/bert-tiny](https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny). 
Data is generated from CNN Daily Mail dataset using 
[SueNes](https://github.com/forrestbao/SueNes).

#### Train Model
- `cd transformer`
- `python3 bert_tiny_cnndm_pt.py`

#### Test Model
- `python3 bert_tiny_cnndm_pt_wrap.py`


<!-- ## Dependencies and environment
* The negative sampling code requires TF 2.x and [`tensorflow_datasets`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets). 
* The `bert` code requires TF 1.15. We run our experiments using [nVidia's TF fork](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tensorflow). 
* SpaCy is needed for segmentation. 
* System: Ubuntu 20.04, 64GB RAM, RTX 3090


## To repeat our experiments

First, create folders under the directory of this project:

```bash
mkdir exp exp/data exp/result
```

### 1. Negative sampling
Code for generating negative samples are in `pre` folder. 

```bash
cd pre
python3 sentence_scramble.py # for sentence-level mutations 
python3 sample_generation.py # for crosspairing and word-level mutations
```
Configrations corresponding to the two Python scripts above are in  `sentence_conf.py` and `sample_generation.py`. Edit them to change negative sampling settings. 

### 2. Model training and test 

Code for model training and test is in the `bert` folder. 

Suppose now you are still in `pre` folder. 
```bash
cd ../bert # go one level up and then into the bert folder 
bash run_classifier.sh 
```

It will call our modified BERT's `run_classifier.py` script to train negative samples just generated above and to test on Newsroom, RealSumm, and TAC2010. Variable names in our `run_classifier.sh` bash script are made very self-explaintory for you to conveniently change the settings, such as the training set, test set, etc. 

Our `run_classifier.py` script hard-codes paths for the three test sets as: `./newsroom_60.tsv`, `./realsumm_100.tsv`, and `./TAC2010_all`. The files `newsroom_60.tsv` and `realsumm_100.tsv` are in this repo for convenience. TAC2010 is not because its access requires approval from NIST. All three files can be generated from raw data using scripts under `human` folder. Please refer to the README file under `human/{newsroom, realsumm, tac}` for information. 

### 3. Aligning with human evaluations 

Code for computing the correlation between our models' predictions and human ratings from the three datasets is in the `human` folder. 

## MISC 
Additional code are kept for reference, e.g., used in early stage of the development of our appproach:   
* `embed`: Scripts for sentence-level embedding. Kept for reference.
* `old`: Sentence-level models. Kept for reference. 

## Baselines and upperbounds

### Baselines: without using human-written reference summaries
* SUPERT: using heuristics to generate psedo-summaries
* BLANC: converting summary quality assessment into a question anwersing problem
* SummaQA: converting summary quality assessment into a question anwersing problem
* SUM-QE and WS_Score: problematic work 

### Upperbounds: using human-written reference summaries -->
